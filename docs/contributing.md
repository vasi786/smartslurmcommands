## 2. Library Responsibilities

`lib/util.sh`
If the logic can be reused across commands and doesn't involve Slurm semantics, it belongs here.

`lib/slurm.sh`
If the logic interacts with `squeue`, `scancel`, `sbatch`, or Slurm fields → it belongs here.

## 3. Command Structure

Every command under `cmd/<tool>/<tool>.sh` must:

- have a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
- `set -Eeuo pipefail` and `IFS=$'\n\t'`
- load required libs in order:

```
source "$SSC_HOME/lib/core.sh"
source "$SSC_HOME/lib/util.sh"
source "$SSC_HOME/lib/slurm.sh"
```

avoid duplicating logic when util/slurm already provides helper functions.

## 4. Coding Standards

### Shell Style

I am following:

- POSIX-ish Bash, but Bash-only features allowed (mapfile, arrays, [[ ]])
- `set -Eeuo pipefail` always at top
- No eval
- No modification of global variables in util/slurm functions
- Functions prefixed with namespace:
```
util::foo
slurm::bar
core::baz
```

### 5. Testing

Test Framework: `bats-core`

All automated tests use bats. I have divide tests as:

- Unit tests (tests/unit/)
  These test pure functions:
  - util functions
  - slurm functions (using mocks)
  - time helpers
  Command execution must NOT appear here.

- Integration tests (tests/integration/)

  These run the actual commands end-to-end:
  - smartcancel with stdin
  - smartqueue filters
  - mqpwd behaviour
  - Default/fallback behaviour

- Mock Slurm

  I have simulated Slurm using:
  ```
  tests/helpers/slurm_mocks/squeue (not implemented yet)
  tests/helpers/slurm_mocks/scancel
  tests/helpers/slurm_mocks/sbatch (not implemented yet)
  ```
  `mock_slurm_path` prepends them to PATH.

This ensures tests run everywhere (GitHub Actions, macOS, developers’ machines) without Slurm.

### Running Tests Manually
```
chmod +x tests/helpers/slurm_mocks/*
bats -r tests/
```
